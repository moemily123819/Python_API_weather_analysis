Observations of the results of WeatherPy :

Highest temperatures can be found in the areas between latitudes -20째 and +20째. 
This is the tropical area, 20째 above the equator and 20째 below the equator. And 
it gets colder when the latitude goes higher north of the equator.

High humidity, however, is not found in the areas around the equator. It is 
because humidity has other factors such as the location of the city is close to the ocean, 
behind a mountain range or in valley.  So high humidity is not due to the latitude of a 
geographic location.

In addition, cloudiness and speed of wind are not affected by the latitude of a city either.
